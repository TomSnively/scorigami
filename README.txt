In the NFL, &ldquo;Scorigami&rdquo; is a game that ends with a final score that has never before occurred in NFL history. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_bois">Jon Bois</a>, and described in a <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2016/12/7/13856392/chart-party-scorigami">Chart Party blog entry</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9l5C8cGMueY">YouTube video</a>.

I am trying to make a node.js application that uses MySQL to store how many of each score have taken place.

When the board is being built, it will query the database to see which scores have happened (possibly with a link to https://www.pro-football-reference.com/.

It will draw the current chart. I'd possibly like a list of the 10 most recent Scorigamis.

To do list:

[x] Draw the chart
[x] Get the app running on node.js
[x] Get the data from a temporary JSON file
[ ] Draw the chart based on the data
[ ] Set up the MySQL database
[ ] Query the database
[ ] Have a back-end routine that gets updated scores from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/
